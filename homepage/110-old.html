Greetings you who had enough interest in a Boss DR-110 to seek out this page.  Hopefully with time I can make this a real resource for the little silver beat box we've come to love.  You'll find more info than you really wanted to know, plus some goodies like schematics,  programming instructions, a page of charts for recording your DR-110 rhythms (in case you're too cheap to buy the batteries to keep your memory going) a spec sheet, and some other interesting (heh) information.  I'd like to get a MOD archive going, and I've <i>finally gotten some DIN SYNC info</i>, but so far nothing solid like schemes.  I have finally gotten one or two DR-110s to tweak around with, and I'll let you know what good that will do. <P><B>Hey you!  Thanks to the genius of <A HREF="mailto:alphadog303@hotmail.com">David Terril</A>, I've got a <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/9730/110.html">DIN SYNC mod</A> to share with you!  So go to <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/9730/">his page</A> and sign his guestbook and tell him how much of a badass he is and that you're so glad you've finally got DIN SYNC for the DR-110.  At least thank him.  Give his page a hit. <P> If you have any information regarding a DR-110 Mod you'd like to share with the world</B>, if you've got a DR-110 and would like to see how little I'd pay for it, or have any DR-110 questions, please contact me at <A HREF="mailto:levithnt@nfdc.net">levithnt@nfdc.net</A>.

<LI>At the time, Roland produced a 40 page booklet (written by <I>Sandy Feldstein</I>) for the DR-110, "A Step-By-Step Approach to learning the Dr. Rhythm Graphic" (As if the manual wasn't simple enough).  "This Handy Guide will teach you how to:<BR>

Pretty cheesy, sold for $2.95 retail by Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. (Book #2453) also published in 1984.<BR>
<LI><B>Test Mode: </B> When you turn on your DR-110, hold down the start and stop buttons.  The entire LED screen should show, though dimly.  Press all your blue buttons, and if they all work, a big OK should appear. Good job, you have a working unit<BR> 
<LI><B>Sample Set: </B> Well, this isn't a complete one cause it's missing the half open hihat, but <A HREF="http://www.hyperreal.org/music/machines/categories/drum-machines/DR-110/samples/dr110kit.zip">someone else did it</A> so it's not my fault<BR>

Now you can do that DIN SYNC thang, mod your sounds, and all kinds of fun.  I hope this is all you need.  If not, e-mail me and I'll scan some more giant B&W pics in.  <I>HEY, send me your mod information dammit!  No one else has yet!</I>  I expect to see some soon.
<LI><B>FYI</B> - All color DR-110 pics here are snagged off of <A HREF="http://www.ebay.com">ebay</A> from various recent auctions, perhaps touched up in Photoshop.  I figure the owners won't care, hell they're selling the thing right? That and I'm just too lazy to take pictures of mine and scan em. This also is my vote of confidence that these items are selling, you just gotta keep on looking.

<CENTER><B>PREPARING TO WRITE A RHYTHM</B></CENTER><BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Connect an amplifier or headphones to the output of your DR-110.<P>
2. Turn the POWER on and set the VOLUME to a little under half.<P>
3. Turn TEMPO, BALANCE, and ACCENT to their mid-points.  In the beginning, you may wish to set the TEMPO slower.  The second line is a good place to start.<P>
4. Hold SHIFT button down and press button 4.  STEP WRITE will appear in the lower right hand box of the LCD screen.  This tells the DR-110 you are going to write a rhythm.<P>
5.  Press BANK SELECTOR button (A|B|C|D) to A.  A will appear under BANK (lower middle box of screen).  If B appears, press button again for A.<P>
6.  Press button 1.  1 will appear on the screen under RHYTHM.  This tells the DR-110 you are going to store the beat in SELECTOR 1.<P>
7. Hold SHIFT button down and press 7 (under PATTERN CLEAR).  This will erase anything previously stored in SELECTOR 1.<P>
8. Hold SHIFT button down and press 6 (12/16).  You will see a little arrow at the top of the graph on your screen.  The arrow will alternate between 12 and 16.  Press 6 until the arrow is above 16.  This tells the memory that you are writting a pattern with 4 beats in each measure and that each beat is divided in 4 parts for a total of 16.  Since the procedure for preparing the DR. RHYTHM is always the same, the sooner you memorize this procedure, the more fun you'll have.<P><HR NOSHADE>
<CENTER>WRITING THE BEAT</CENTER>
Select the instrument that you are going to enter by pressing the corresponding button.  For example, the Closed Hi-Hat.  Press the C. HIHAT button and on the screen you will see a flashing black dot on the C. HIHAT line.  (note: Dot flashes at tempo machine is set at)<P>
When you press the Start Button, a solid dot will appear.  When you press the STOP key, the flashing dot will move to the next position.  Each dot entered will indicate a note.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B>Some paraphrased user comments regarding the DR-110, from Synth Site at www.sonicstate.com</B><P></CENTER>
<LI><A HREF="mailto:industrialboy@hotmail.com">Alex Baumann</A> - The coolest part is you can bounce the hihats.  With most sample based machines you can't put the open and closed hats on top of eachother and get a different sound, but the half-opened hat feature really adds to the mix.  The other great thing is the use of a few batteries and you can take it with you.  If you had big pockets, you could fit it in your pocket.  I wonder what circuit they use on the handclap, it sounds almost underwater, it's great, I've never heard anything like it.  5 out of 5 rating.<BR>
<LI><A HREF="mailto:sasundb@ibm.net">Scott A. Sundberg</A> - This was my first drum machine, way back in '83.  "Great fun and great sounds!"  The trigger-out feature works well if you have a machine that will accept it.  Used to run a Roland SH-101 with it, but sold mine a few years later.  "Two years ago, I found another DR-110 for only 30 bucks! Had to get it." 5 out of 5 rating.<BR>
<LI><A HREF="mailto:juno106@webtv.net">Erik</A> - This was my first drum machine ever, and I still have it.  "Coolest feature: when you enter a closed hat on top of a open one it will play
half-open and will save into the pattern.  This unit is monophonic, noisy, and cannot be synced." You CAN program an accent into the track and trigger another instrument, but I've never tried.  As a toy, I give it a 5 out of 5, but as a professional musical instrument, I give it a 1 out of 5.
<LI><A HREF="mailto:anthony@amudarya.demon.co.uk">Anthony Bowyer-Lowe</A> - "Fantastic sounds - those hats and cymbal are sooo damn sweet. Big win: the 110 is battery powered and small so can be taken on train/bus/plane journeys for groovin' on the move. Shame about the lack of sync, but for the small amount of cash these go for, they really are good fun." 4 out of 5 rating.

<BLOCKQUOTE>No I'm no psycho collector, I just was pissed off when I went looking for information about a DR-110 and came up pretty short.  When I got my DR-110 though, I payed $50 to recieve the Manual, Booklet, Boss Power Supply (worth $25 on it's own), Case, and Machine in museum-like mint condition, complete with vintage smell.  In asking around I got a few requests from people that if I did get one, I copy the manual or whatever, so I figured I'd put this page up because I got enough with my machine to post a lot of useful info about it that plenty of other people really could use.  No, don't bother to ask if I'm going to sell my drum machine unless you're going to offer something ridiculous for it.  <I>You can find it for a lot cheaper than I'll be asking for mine!</I>  What I am interested in are broken or unused DR-110s you may be willing to part with for a reasonable price.  Or if you have any information on modifications you'd like the world to see.  Or know some famous bands that have implemented the Dr Rhyhtm Graphic into one of their more popular songs.  Whatever, just send me an e-mail, on the net I go by <A HREF="mailto:levithnt@nfdc.net">Leviathant</A>, and am probably better known for my NIN website, <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/leviathant/index.html">Nails in my Head</A>.  Send me a message, let me know what you wanna see on this site!<P>
