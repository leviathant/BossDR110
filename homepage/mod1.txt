Subject: Boss Dr-110 sync/mod info


There was discussion a while back on this list about sync mods for the
Boss Dr. Rhythm 110.  Someone hinted at the possibility, and at least half
a dozen people responded with interest.  Nothing else came of it, however
(as far as I can tell).  So I finally decided to bust open my own box and
give it a look-see.  <DISCLAIMER> The results here were derived with crude
equipment and my own intuition.  No guarantee is made to their accuracy or
safety, either to self or machine. </DISCLAIMER>  OK, now here's the
scoop:

First, to backtrack to what the Roland DIN Sync standard is, here's a bit
of a posting from rein0004@frank.mtsu.edu Fri Feb 23 08:12:57 1996:
------------
To clarify what has already been posted, the pins are as follows:
                                pin 2
                       pin 5             pin 4
              pin 3                               pin 1
                                  *
                               *     *
                             *         *
(Excuse the drawing)
This is looking at the rear view of the connector.  The pins are 
basically what has been posted:

pin #		tr-808		tr-606/tb-303		cr-1000
1		start/stop	start/stop		start/stop
2		ground		ground			ground		
3		tempo clock	tempo clock		tempo clock	
4		reset		tap			not used	
5		fill in		not used		not used

The control voltage is 0 to +5 volts DC.

OK, so what we're looking for at minimum is a start/stop and a tempo
clock, which for Roland means 24 ppq (pulses per quarter note).

I'll save you the gory details of my explorations and cut to results.  I
found what I'm pretty sure is the tempo clock, though I could not count
the pulses that fast off the voltmeter.  Sure looked like it could be 24
ppq, but only way to tell is with better equipment or to sync it to
something else and see if it works.  I also found CV's for the individual
drum sounds.  I did not isolate the start/stop voltages, but if you dug
down further I bet the start/stop buttons would be a good place to start
looking!  Here's where to look:

Open the box by taking off the three screws on the back.  To do any
tinkering you'll need an ext. power supply, as the battery compartment
goes with the back cover.  (I've been using the 10V supply from a Sega
Genesis, but this is really a do-it-at-your-own-risk!)  You'll also have
to pull of the knobs to open it, but they are slotted to they'll go back
just the way they came off.  Turn the unit so the top is facing you.  (The
power switch and DC & trigger jacks will be on the bottom right.)  Now,
see the white bus wires that run between the two circuit boards?  That's
where you'll find what you're looking for.  The way the unit is facing
you, you're looking at the bottom of the board, where the leads from the
bus stick out.  Now, count carefully, there are 18 wires on that bus.
(Make sure you start all the way at the left, but start *after* the diode
lead that's right there).

Still with me?  OK, now numbering the bus wires #1-18, from left-to-right,
the (suspected) clock pulse is on #4.  To check it, use a voltmeter set to
a 0 to +5 range.  Ground the negative probe (I used the negative battery
clip) and touch wire #4, and you should see the needle bob fast.  This
varies as you turn the tempo knob.

The CV's for the individual instruments are as follows:

wire#	voice
9	cymbal
10	o. hat
11	c. hat
12	kick	
13	snare
15	claps
16	accent

There are two ways to check these out.  One, do the voltmeter thing while
running a rhythm pattern.  You will see the voltage is held at +5, and
when the voice fires, the voltage dips down.  Two, use a plain wire lead,
ground one end to the -battery clip, and touch the other end to the
respective bus wire.  This causes the voice to fire off, repeatedly (prob
at every pulse of the clock).  CAUTION:  I consulted someone more
knowledgable in electronics after I had done this, and was told that
grounding out the wires like this *could* cause damage, depending on the
type of logic circuit used.  An "open collector" style one would be fine,
while a TTL or "transistor-transistor logic" one might get upset.  Given
the relatively slow speeds that a rhythm machine must run at, compared to
CPU's, it's probably the open collector style.  Anyone with more
electronics experience is welcome to shed light on this, esp. someone who
also has a coveted schematic for this unit!

OK, that's my findings, it's up to you to take it from here.  There's not
much room in there to mount a DIN jack, but I'm sure that could be worked
around.  Good luck,
	Leigh
